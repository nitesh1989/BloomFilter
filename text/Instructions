Check weather the split-genome function is working as you expect.

Goal: Filter the indexes to be looked up while aligning the reads.


Steps:

We have the Fastq file of all the chromosomes, broken genome indexes.

1. Construct k-mers (20-mers) of reads. (Construct 20-mers of what? Fastq files??)

2. Bloom filters, to hold k-mers which hold 

What do we need to store in the Bloomfilter?
-- Reads


We need to filter reads from the genome in such a way, that we
